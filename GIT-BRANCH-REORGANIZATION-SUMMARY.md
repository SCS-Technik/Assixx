### Branch Strategy

All development follows the feature-branch workflow as documented in GIT-BRANCH-STRATEGY.md:

1. Features are developed in feature/\* branches
2. Merged to develop for integration testing
3. Experimental features go to experimental branch first
4. Production releases from master

### Next Steps

- Developers should checkout relevant feature branches for their work
- All new features must follow the branch naming convention
- Regular cleanup of merged branches should be performed
