# Path Injection Security Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-14

### Issue Description
GitHub CodeQL alerts (#1442-#1450) identified multiple Path Injection vulnerabilities in the Assixx codebase where user input was used in file paths without proper validation.

### Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### 1. Created Path Security Utility Module
- **File**: `/backend/src/utils/pathSecurity.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized security functions for path validation and sanitization
- **Functions**:
  - `validatePath()`: Validates paths to prevent directory traversal
  - `sanitizeFilename()`: Removes dangerous characters from filenames
  - `createSecurePath()`: Creates secure paths within allowed directories
  - `isAllowedExtension()`: Validates file extensions
  - `getUploadDirectory()`: Returns secure upload directories by type

#### 2. Fixed Multer Upload Configurations
Updated multer configurations in the following files to use sanitized filenames:
- `/backend/src/routes/documents.ts` - Document uploads
- `/backend/src/routes/users.ts` - Profile picture uploads  
- `/backend/src/routes/user.ts` - Profile picture uploads
- `/backend/src/routes/admin.ts` - Admin document uploads
- `/backend/src/routes/blackboard.ts` - Blackboard attachments
- `/backend/src/routes/chat.ts` - Chat file uploads
- `/backend/src/routes/kvp.ts` - KVP image uploads

#### 3. Fixed File Serving Vulnerabilities
Updated file serving endpoints to validate paths before sending:
- `/backend/src/routes/user.ts` - Profile picture serving endpoint
- `/backend/src/routes/blackboard.ts` - Attachment download/preview endpoints
- `/backend/src/routes/documents.ts` - Document file operations

### Security Measures Implemented

1. **Path Validation**: All file paths are validated to ensure they stay within allowed directories
2. **Filename Sanitization**: Removes path separators, null bytes, and other dangerous characters
3. **Directory Traversal Prevention**: Blocks patterns like `../`, `..\\`, and URL-encoded variants
4. **Centralized Security**: All path operations use the same security utility module

### Testing Performed
- TypeScript compilation successful (`pnpm run type-check`)
- Build process completed without errors (`pnpm run build:ts`)
- All unused imports removed to fix linting issues

### Recommendations
1. Always use the `pathSecurity` utility functions when handling file paths
2. Never concatenate user input directly into file paths
3. Validate all file operations against a whitelist of allowed directories
4. Regularly audit file handling code for security vulnerabilities

### Files Modified
1. `/backend/src/utils/pathSecurity.ts` (created)
2. `/backend/src/routes/documents.ts`
3. `/backend/src/routes/users.ts`
4. `/backend/src/routes/user.ts`
5. `/backend/src/routes/admin.ts`
6. `/backend/src/routes/blackboard.ts`
7. `/backend/src/routes/chat.ts`
8. `/backend/src/routes/kvp.ts`
