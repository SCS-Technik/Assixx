# Typed Route Handlers Migration Summary

## Overview

Applied typed route handlers to fix TypeScript errors in route files as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. `/home/scs/projects/Assixx/backend/src/routes/auth.ts`

- Added import: `import { typed } from '../utils/routeHandlers';`
- Wrapped inline route handlers with appropriate typed wrappers:
  - `typed.auth()` for authenticated routes
  - `typed.public()` for public routes
- Removed unused imports (Response, AuthenticatedRequest, PublicRequest)

### 2. `/home/scs/projects/Assixx/backend/src/routes/availability.ts`

- Initially added typed import but removed it
- This file uses controller methods directly, not inline handlers
- No typed wrappers needed for controller-based routes

### 3. `/home/scs/projects/Assixx/backend/src/routes/blackboard.ts`

- Added imports:
  - `import { typed } from '../utils/routeHandlers';`
  - `import { AuthenticatedRequest } from '../types/request.types';`
  - `import { security } from '../middleware/security';`
  - `import { successResponse, errorResponse } from '../types/response.types';`
  - `import { createValidation } from '../middleware/validation';`
  - `import { param } from 'express-validator';`
- Imported types from blackboard model:
  - `import type { EntryQueryOptions, EntryCreateData } from '../models/blackboard';`
- Wrapped all inline route handlers with appropriate typed wrappers:
  - `typed.auth()` for authenticated routes
  - `typed.params<T>()` for routes with params
  - `typed.body<T>()` for routes with body
  - `typed.paramsBody<T, B>()` for routes with both params and body
- Fixed type issues:
  - Removed references to `tenant_id` (now uses `tenantId`)
  - Added proper type casting for query parameters
  - Fixed entry creation data types

## Remaining TypeScript Errors

### Controller Type Issues

The following errors are related to controller methods expecting `AuthenticatedRequest` but receiving standard `Request` from Express:

1. **auth.ts**: Controller methods (login, register, logout) have type mismatches
2. **availability.ts**: All controller methods have type mismatches

These are issues within the controller implementations, not the route definitions. The controllers need to be updated to properly handle the request types or use type guards.

## Key Improvements

1. Type safety for inline route handlers
2. Proper request type inference in route handlers
3. Removed explicit `: Promise<void>` return types (inferred automatically)
4. Removed explicit `Response` parameter types (inferred from typed wrappers)
5. Fixed type issues in blackboard routes with proper imports and type casting

## Export Updates

Updated blackboard model exports to include:

- `EntryQueryOptions`
- `EntryCreateData`

These types are now properly imported and used in the blackboard routes.
