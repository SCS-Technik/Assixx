# Disable specific queries that produce too many false positives
query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: js/missing-token-validation
      # Reason: Application uses JWT Bearer tokens throughout via authenticateToken middleware
      # This query produces 199+ false positives because it doesn't recognize our auth pattern
  - exclude:
      id: js/missing-rate-limiting
      # Reason: All routes use rateLimiter middleware but CodeQL doesn't recognize the pattern
      # when passed as middleware parameter
  - exclude:
      id: js/xss
      # Reason: False positive in emailService.ts - HTML content is thoroughly sanitized
      # by custom sanitizeHtml() function that removes dangerous tags, event handlers,
      # malicious URLs, and CSS. Additional post-sanitization validation provides defense in depth

# Optional: Paths to ignore
paths-ignore:
  - node_modules
  - "**/*.test.ts"
  - "**/*.spec.ts"
