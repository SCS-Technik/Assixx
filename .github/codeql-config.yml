# Disable specific queries that produce too many false positives
query-filters:
  - exclude:
      id: js/missing-token-validation
      # Reason: Application uses JWT Bearer tokens throughout via authenticateToken middleware
      # This query produces 199+ false positives because it doesn't recognize our auth pattern
  - exclude:
      id: js/missing-rate-limiting  
      # Reason: All routes use rateLimiter middleware but CodeQL doesn't recognize the pattern
      # when passed as middleware parameter

# Optional: Paths to ignore
